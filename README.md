# Hi Factored Team!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). I used NextJS because its based on React and I'm used to it, hopefully there's no issues with that.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mauriciosilvera/factored.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

And you should be good to go!
